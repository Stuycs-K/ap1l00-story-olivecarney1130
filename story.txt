Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on TV, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about 
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the city. It is a way I have of driving off the 
road and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the world; 
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my car; whenever I find myself involuntarily 
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> before coffin nails, and bringing up the rear of every donkey I meet; and 
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> 
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the river, and methodically 
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's personalities off—then, I account it high time to get to solution as soon as I can. 
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all scholars in their degree, 
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the bourgeoisie with me.
